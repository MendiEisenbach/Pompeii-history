          <p>
            Pompeii, located near the Bay of Naples in Italy, was a thriving
            Roman city founded around the 7th century BCE. Known for its vibrant
            markets, detailed mosaics, and luxurious villas, it became a vital
            cultural and commercial center in the Roman Empire.

          <p>
            Positioned in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius, Pompeii flourished for
            centuries. Its streets were lined with shops, bathhouses, and
            temples. Life in Pompeii reflected the Roman way — art, leisure,
            religion, and hierarchy. But nature had other plans.
