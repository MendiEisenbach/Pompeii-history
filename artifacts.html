        <h2>Frozen in Ash</h2>

          <p>
            When Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE, it buried Pompeii under meters
            of volcanic ash. That catastrophe preserved thousands of everyday
            objects — tools, graffiti, jewelry, food, and even loaves of bread.
            These relics are windows into Roman life, not as imagined, but as it
            truly was.

          <p>
            Many artifacts were discovered in their original places: wine jugs
            in taverns, dice in gaming halls, bronze mirrors in dressing rooms.
            The ash didn't just freeze buildings — it captured life.
