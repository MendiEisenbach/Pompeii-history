        <h2>Voices from the Ashes</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Pompeii was more than marble streets and painted walls — it was a
            living city of people with hopes, jobs, loves, and fears. Bakers
            rose early, senators debated, and children ran through courtyards.
            The volcano did not care about rank.
          </p>

            Among the known residents was **Caecilius Iucundus**, a wealthy
            banker whose home was filled with frescoes and mosaics. His
            preserved records tell us about trade and debt in the city. Other
            figures include gladiators, priests, and enslaved workers — each
            caught in a final moment.

          <p>
            Caecilius, a respected banker and one of Pompeii’s wealthier
            citizens, lived in a grand domus adorned with fine mosaics and
            intricate frescoes. Among the ashes, scrolls and wax tablets were
            uncovered—records of trades, loans, and contracts that painted a
            portrait of a man immersed in both commerce and culture. His home
            whispered of ambition, learning, and the daily rhythm of Roman
            economic life.

          <summary>The Gladiator's Quarters</summary>
          <p>
            In the shadow of the arena, the barracks held the echo of clashing
            metal and shouted drills. Helmets, greaves, and wooden training
            swords were found strewn across the floor, as if abandoned
            mid-routine. These warriors—enslaved yet idolized—trained hard for
            fleeting glory in the amphitheater. Their quarters were modest,
            their lives brutal, yet they stood as living legends to the cheering
            crowd.

          <summary>A Child and Her Dog</summary>
          <p>
            One of the most poignant discoveries: the delicate cast of a young
            girl, no older than seven, curled protectively beside her loyal dog.
            Their final moment, preserved in ash, tells a silent story of
            innocence and devotion amidst chaos. Their outlines are so gentle,
            so human, that even centuries later they speak directly to the heart
            — a reminder that tragedy touches the smallest lives too.
